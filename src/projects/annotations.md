## Implementing an Accessibility Annotations Framework in Figma

**Impact**: Reduced design-related accessibility defects by 45% and cut engineering clarification time by 6 hours per sprint across 80+ designers at Fidelity Investments.

**Role**: Principal Accessibility Designer/Initiative Lead | **Timeline**: 8 months | **Team**: Partnership with UX Designer

### The Challenge

Engineers were making "best guesses" about accessibility requirements during design handoffs, resulting in focus mismanagement, inappropriate ARIA roles, and missing keyboard navigation. With 80+ designers shipping to hundreds of products, these systematic gaps were creating technical debt and compliance risk.

### My Approach

I led discovery research with 10+ designers and 6 engineers to identify the root cause: both groups wanted clearer communication but lacked a shared system. I designed a comprehensive annotation framework that would integrate into existing Figma workflows and created a training program to support adoption.

**Research → Design → Pilot → Rollout**: Conducted stakeholder interviews, developed 15 annotation patterns covering focus order, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation, tested with 3 pilot teams, then launched to all designers through workshops and office hours.

### The Solution

A standardized Figma-based annotation system with 15 patterns that communicate focus order, ARIA requirements, component structure, and interaction states. Each annotation includes visual indicators, descriptive labels, and implementation guidelines—no additional tools required.

### Impact & Outcomes

- **45% reduction** in design-related accessibility defects
- **4 hours saved per sprint** on engineering clarification (8 hours → 2 hours)
- **50% decrease** in accessibility questions during office hours  
- **70% adoption** across design team within 3 months
- Established as standard practice in design system governance

### Key Insight

Designers learned accessibility principles *through* using annotations rather than requiring extensive upfront training. By embedding education into the workflow, we achieved faster adoption and deeper retention—the annotations became both a communication tool and a learning scaffold.
