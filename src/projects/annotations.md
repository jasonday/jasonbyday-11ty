title: Accessibility Annotations
description: "The Fidelity Accessibility Requirements (FAR) framework I developed at Fidelity Investments stands as an innovative approach in digital accessibility. Unlike traditional methods that overwhelm teams with exhaustive WCAG criteria, FAR's tiered structure empowered product teams to own accessibility testing."

## Implementing an Accessibility Annotations Framework in Figma

**My Role**: Principal Accessibility Designer  
**My Contributions**: Led program management, conducted user research, authored the Fidelity Accessibility Requirements (FAR) framework  


### Overview

This case study details the development and implementation of an accessibility annotations framework within Figma. The goal was to empower designers to effectively communicate accessibility requirements to developers, ensuring that designs are implemented in an accessible manner. This framework focuses on providing clear, concise annotations that streamline the design handoff process.

### Problem

Historically, accessibility considerations were often addressed late in the development lifecycle, leading to:

* Inaccessible products being launched.
* Increased rework and development costs.
* Inconsistent implementation of accessibility standards.
* Lack of clear communication between designers and developers regarding accessibility requirements.

### Goals & Objectives

The accessibility annotations framework aimed to:

* Enable designers to document accessibility features within the design process.
* Improve the clarity and consistency of accessibility communication between design and development.
* "Shift accessibility left" by integrating accessibility considerations earlier in the design workflow.
* Provide a scalable solution that can adapt to evolving accessibility needs and varying team expertise.
* Increase awareness of accessibility within the design team.

### Solution: Accessibility Annotations Framework in Figma

The solution was the development of an accessibility annotations framework within Figma, based on key operational principles:

* **Keep it simple & clear:** Annotations should be easy to understand and avoid unnecessary complexity.
* **Donâ€™t annotate things that are already defined in a design system/UI kit:** Avoid redundancy by relying on accessibility considerations already built into design system components.
* **No implementation guidance:** Focus on communicating design intent, not dictating development implementation.
* **Build for scalability:** The framework should accommodate increased annotation complexity and varying levels of accessibility understanding.

The framework includes components and guidelines for annotating various accessibility aspects within Figma designs:

* **Accessible Labels:** Providing additional context for interactive elements like icon buttons or links where visual proximity doesn't provide sufficient context.
* **Headings:** Indicating the appropriate heading levels to structure content hierarchy.
* **States:** Documenting UI element states (e.g., focus, active, disabled) when not already defined in the design system.
* **Focus Order:** Specifying the logical focus order for interactive elements, particularly in complex interactions or dynamic content.
* **Focus Management:** Describing how focus should be managed in dynamic experiences where content updates or changes.
* **Text Alternatives:** Ensuring meaningful alternative text is provided for images, or indicating when images are decorative.
* **Informational:** A generic annotation for providing additional context or designer intent related to accessibility.
* **Page/View Titles:** Specifying descriptive titles for pages or views to provide context for users, especially those using assistive technologies.
* **Required/Optional Fields:** Indicating form field requirements.
* **ARIA Live Announcements:** Noting elements that should be announced to screen reader users, such as status messages.
* **New Components:** Guidance is provided for documenting accessibility considerations when designing new components, including keyboard interactions, states, and focus order.

### Process

1.  **Framework Development:** Created Figma components and established guidelines for annotating accessibility.
2.  **Implementation and Training:** Provided training and documentation to design teams on how to use the framework.
3.  **Pilot Projects:** Applied the framework to pilot projects to gather feedback and refine the process.
4.  **Iteration and Improvement:** Continuously updated the framework based on user feedback and evolving accessibility best practices.

### Outcomes

The implementation of the accessibility annotations framework resulted in:

* Improved communication and collaboration between designers and developers on accessibility requirements.
* Increased consistency in the implementation of accessibility standards.
* Earlier consideration of accessibility in the design process, reducing the need for rework.
* Greater awareness and understanding of accessibility principles among designers.
* More efficient handoff of designs to development teams.

### Key Achievements

* **Shifted Accessibility Left:** The framework enabled designers to integrate accessibility considerations directly into their design files.
* **Improved Communication:** Clear and consistent annotations facilitated better communication of accessibility requirements.
* **Increased Efficiency:** Streamlined handoff process reduced ambiguity and rework.
* **Scalable Solution:** The framework is designed to be scalable and adaptable to different project needs and team expertise.
* **Proactive Approach:** By focusing on accessibility annotations, the framework proactively addresses potential accessibility issues early in the design phase.

### Learnings

* **Simplicity is Key:** Emphasizing clear and concise annotations is crucial for adoption and effectiveness.
* **Design System Integration:** Leveraging accessibility features built into the design system reduces redundancy.
* **Ongoing Training and Support:** Continuous training and support are essential for successful implementation and adoption.
* **Collaboration and Iteration:** Ongoing collaboration between design and development and iterative framework improvements are critical.

### Conclusion

The Figma accessibility annotations framework provides a structured approach for integrating accessibility into the design process. By empowering designers to clearly communicate accessibility requirements, this framework fosters collaboration, improves efficiency, and contributes to the development of more accessible digital products.
